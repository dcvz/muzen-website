      <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>
        Muzen allows you to share and listen to music with others. You can use the application
        without an account therefore we do not collect any personally-identifying information.
        If you decide to use our service using Spotify as the media provider, the login
        is handled through their system and we do not store any information from Spotify.
      </p>

      <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>No Personally-Identifying Information is transmitted to our servers when using Muzen.</p>

      <p>
        We collect anonymous usage data and crash reports through Amplitude & Fabric. This makes it easier for
        us to troubleshoot problems and improve Muzen. Hence Usage Data is collected only to operate and improve
        the app and customer support.
      </p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        The security of your personal data also depends on you. You should not share your Spotify username and
        password with anyone. If you believe or find out that your login credentials are in the wrong hands,
        you should immediately change your password.
      </p>
